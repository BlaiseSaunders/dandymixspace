							A quote from a co-worker:
						</h3>
						<p>
							"If you asked him to fix a problem with a system he'd never seen before and locked him in a room with it, <br/>
							when you came back in 8 hours he'd have re-written the system from scratch because he didn't like the first one, <br/>
							but if you sent him back in for	5 minutes he'd have whatever problem you might have sorted"
						</p>
